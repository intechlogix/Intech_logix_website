# Placeholder Logo Files Directory

This directory should contain your company logo files in the following formats:

## Required Files:
- logo-16x16.png
- logo-32x32.png
- logo-180x180.png
- logo-192x192.png
- logo-512x512.png
- logo-og.png (1200x630 for social sharing)

## Current Status:
❌ Logo files missing - this is why you see a generic world icon in search results

## Quick Fix:
1. Create simple text-based logos with "Intech Logix" branding
2. Use tools like Canva, Figma, or online logo makers
3. Upload files to this directory
4. Test with Google Search Console Rich Results Test

## Color Scheme:
- Primary: #3b82f6 (blue)
- Secondary: #1e293b (dark)
- Background: #ffffff (white)

After adding these files, search engines will display your company logo instead of the generic world icon.
